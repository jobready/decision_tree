# Decision Tree

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/ed9359ddd05b5fcf16c05eebd63e23d303b3028cd4daf2d32d.svg)](https://buildkite.com/jobready/decision-tree)

Decision Tree is an easy way of defining rules/workflows that progress an
object's state through a series of boolean decisions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'decision_tree'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install decision_tree

## Usage

Define your workflow by inheriting from `DecisionTree::Workflow`. A `start`
method is required, and will be the entry point into the decision tree.

The actual decisions are declared using the `decision` macro. This takes a
single parameter, which is the name of the method that actually makes the
decision. When called, the decision macro will invoke this method, then
act according to the truthiness of the response returned - invoking the
code in its `yes` block for true, and `no` block for false.

To accommodate interruptions to the decision tree, perhaps at locations where
user input is required, the `entry` macro can be used to define new entry
points. This macro takes the name of the entry point, and can be invoked by
calling this method from outside the workflow class.

For both decision and entry macros, the correspondingly named method *must*
exist in the class, even if it only returns `true`.

```ruby
class TestWorkflow < DecisionTree::Workflow
  def decision_method
    true
  end

  def reviewed_by_staff
    true
  end

  decision :decision_method do
    yes { it_returned_true }
    no { it_returned_false }
  end

  start do
    decision_method
  end

  entry :reviewed_by_staff do
    decision_method
  end
end

TestWorkflow.new(state_object)
```

##Implementing State

Decision trees are intended to be instantiated many times, but in order to
preserve idempotence, there needs to be an object to hold the state between
invocations. This will typically be an ActiveRecord model, with the state
stored in the database.

The state carrier needs to implement a `state!` method that persists the state
(a string) passed to it, and a `start_workflow` method that needs to yield
into the passed block, which is a good place to ensure locks are in place to
guard against simultaneous invocations of the workflow.

```ruby
class Change < ActiveRecord::Base

  def state!(new_state)
    update_attributes(state: new_state)
  end

  def start_workflow(&block)
    with_lock do
      yield
    end
  end
end
```

##Finishing the Workflow
When a workflow has been completed, and you don't want it to evaluate again, you can call `finish!` on the workflow.

```ruby
class TestWorkflow < DecisionTree::Workflow
  def do_something
  	...
  end

  start do
  	do_something
  end

  decision :do_something do
  	yes { finish! }
  	no  { finish! }
  end
end
```

This will mark the workflow as finished in the state cache, and call `store_steps!` on the carrier, passing the list of `DecisionTree::Step` objects that were taken on the path to finishing the workflow. After it is finished, subsequent invocations of the workflow will no longer execute the workflow, but call `fetch_steps` on the state carrier.

## Storing Steps
Implementation of the storage of the steps is left to the application, and does not need to be implemented. DecisionTree will still work correctly without the step storage, but you will be unable to retrieve/display the steps when reloading the workflow after completion. If this is satisfactory, you can leave `store_steps!` and `fetch_steps` empty.

If you do need to store the final steps, below is an example implementation:

```ruby
class Change < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :workflow_steps, as: :workflowable

  def store_steps!(steps)
    workflow_steps.destroy_all

    steps.each_with_index do |step, position|
      new_step = WorkflowStep.from_decision_step(step, self, position)
      new_step.save!
    end
  end

  def fetch_steps
    workflow_steps
  end
end

class WorkflowStep < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :workflowable, polymorphic: true
  default_scope { order(position: :asc) }

  delegate :display, to: :decision_step, allow_nil: true
  def decision_step
    @step ||= DecisionTree::Step.new(step_type, step_info)
  end

  def self.from_decision_step(decision_step, parent, position)
    step_attrs = {
      step_type: decision_step.step_type,
      step_info: decision_step.step_info,
      workflowable: parent,
      position: position
    }
    self.new(step_attrs)
  end
end
```


##Displaying the Workflow
Human readable display of workflow steps can be achieved by using `DecisionTree::Step#display`.
E.g.

```ruby
- workflow.steps.each do |step|
  = step.display
```

The value returned by this will either be one set explicitly in the translations, or one implicitly derived from the step name.


### Explicit Display Values
Human readable translations are defined under `workflow_steps`.

E.g.:

    workflow_steps:
      entry_point:
        __start_workflow: 'Decision Workflow Started'
        reviewed_by_etd!: 'ETD has reviewed the provided evidence'
      idempotent_call:
        mark_for_review!: 'Waiting on ETD to review evidence'
      approval_only_required_from_initiator?:
        'yes': 'Approval is only required from the initiator'
        'no': 'This change must be approved by more than the initiator'

Any entry point into the workflow is defined under `entry_point`, including the initial one that is automatically created by the gem (`__start_workflow`).
Any idempotent calls (identified by a trailing `!`) are defined under `idempotent_call`.

Any regular steps (with a yes/no outcome) are defined directly under `workflow_steps`, and contain values for both 'yes', and 'no'. Note that these keys should be defined as strings (explicitly wrapped in quotes), otherwise YAML helpfully converts these to booleans, which will not be matched when looking for a description.

### Implicit Display Values
Semi-friendly display values are still returned if no translation has been defined.
For a regular step, the question will be rendered, followed by the answer.

```
# method name: is_contract_full_time?
# answer is 'NO'
step.display # => Is contract full time? - No

```

Entry points and idempotent calls are also slightly humanised.

```
:reviewed_by_etd! # => Reviewed by etd!
```
